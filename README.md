# image_caption_generator
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an image captioning model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption for that image. The model architecture involves a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

# Dataset
The Flickr8k dataset has been used for training and evaluation. This dataset consists of images along with five captions describing each image. The captions have been preprocessed to lowercase, remove special characters, and append start and end tokens.

# Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of two main components:

Feature Extractor: A pre-trained convolutional neural network (DenseNet201) is used to extract features from input images.
Caption Generator: This part of the model is responsible for generating captions based on the image features. It involves an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense layers.
Training
The model is trained using a custom data generator to handle a large dataset efficiently. Training is performed over 50 epochs with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve convergence. The training and validation loss curves are plotted using Matplotlib to monitor model performance.

# Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated by generating captions for a sample of images from the test set. The predicted captions are compared against the ground truth captions to assess the model's performance qualitatively.
